# Book Library
## Part of the JavaScript section in "The Odin Project" - Full Stack JavaScript path

### Objectives
Create simple web app where users can store books by name, author, pages, update their status (readed or not) and delete them.
Each book must be stored as book object, all books are displayed with form or card.
For now its not needed to use local or external storage. Everything is done tru the DOM for displaying the added or changed data.
